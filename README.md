# xetal_savvy Twitch Channel Repository

This repository contains everything related to my Twitch channel, including my banner design, channel information, and other assets. The goal of this repository is to keep everything organized in one place and make it easy to share with others.

## Banner Design

The banner design is the main visual element of my Twitch channel and represents my interests and personality. It was created using Canva and features Unsplash photos that reflect my love for heavy metal music, computer vision, computer graphics, and visual integrity.

## Channel Information

In addition to the banner design, this repository also contains information about my Twitch channel, including my bio, streaming schedule, and links to other social media platforms.
